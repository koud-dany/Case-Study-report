# Analysis Project: Client Problem

## Introduction
A client has provided us with historical sales data on their products. The executives at the client's company are seeking advanced analytics to help them make informed decisions about where to focus their sales efforts in the future. This project involves analyzing three key tables: Based Customer, Customer Opportunity, and Product Mapping, which contain essential data regarding historical pipeline/sales, customer details, sales opportunities, and product categories.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis project are as follows:
1. Identify which products the company should prioritize for future sales efforts.
2. Develop a method for the client to determine which customers and sales opportunities to focus on in the future.
3. Uncover the areas where the client has experienced the most success in the past.

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis project is to leverage the historical sales data provided by the client to provide valuable insights that can guide their future sales strategies. By analyzing this data, we aim to address the client's key questions and offer data-driven recommendations to enhance their decision-making process.

## Project Details
- **Data Sources**: The data is spread across several different files, as the client does not maintain a single source system. These files have been de-identified to protect the client's privacy.
- **Data Quality**: It's important to note that there have been data submission errors in the past. This means that the data may require cleaning and validation before analysis.
- **Analysis Goals**: The project will involve a comprehensive analysis of the data to identify trends, outliers, and other insightful analyses that can help the client make informed decisions.

By addressing these objectives and purposes, we aim to provide the client with a robust analytics solution to support their future sales strategies and decision-making processes.
